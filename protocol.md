# Reverse engineered protocol for reference

## Overview

The Topaz signature pads used a packet-based protocol, sent over various interfaces depending on the model. Possible interfaces include raw USB HID messages, RS-232, serial-over-USB, and other wireless interfaces. `libsigpad` and the accompanying kernel driver implement only USB HID for the time being. 

Each packet begins with a command identifier and is followed by a set of big-endian parameters.

## Packet reference

Backlight on:

Field        Type        Notes
-----------  ----------  -------------
Command      `uint16_t`  Always `0xFF02`

Backlight off:

Field        Type        Notes
-----------  ----------  -------------
Command      `uint16_t`  Always `0xFF03`

Bitmap blit:

Field        Type        Notes
-----------  ----------  -------------
Command      `uint16_t`  Always `0xF207`
Mode         `uint8_t`   `0x02` to overwrite the area; `0x03` for transparency
X position   `uint16_t`
Y position   `uint16_t`
Width        `uint16_t`  Should probably be a multiple of 8
Height       `uint16_t`
Bitmap       `pixel[]`   Packed monochrome bitmap; (width * height / 8) bytes large

Rectangle clear:

Field        Type        Notes
-----------  ----------  -------------
Command      `uint16_t`  Always `0xFF12`
Mode         `uint8_t`   Set to 2 to clear, set to 1 to invert (?) region
X position   `uint16_t`  Measured from top-left corner
Y position   `uint16_t`
Width        `uint16_t`
Height       `uint16_t`


## Notes on usage

Due to limits on HID packet length (24 bytes in this case), bitmaps in particular need to be split across several packets, each with a separate header. Delays between packets may be necessary to avoid data corruption, requiring a display restart.

A screen clear can be achieved efficiently by filling a rectangle with mode set to two, from (0, 0) to (width, height).

## Disclaimer

Information was obtained predominantly through fuzzing, trial-and-error, and guesswork. Basic information is from the manufacturer website. Mode names were from the public reference for the official driver API. It is likely the protocol is similar for other models, although YMMV. I am not affiliated with Topaz Systems.
